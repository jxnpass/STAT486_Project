# STAT 486 Project

This project outlines the needed requirements of the project for STAT 486: Machine Learning. A brief description of the respository is as follows:

## Data Folder
Lists the data used for analysis. We had a separate folder called FE (Feature Engineering) that has the data used for the model fitting (standard dataframe, PCA, and Lasso Variable Selection).

## DataBuildingScripts Folder
Handles the building, cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering of the data for the project. Steps were completed in the number each script represents.

## Graphs Folder
Graphs from EDA used

## FitGraphs Folder
Fits the predictions of each model to the number of crimes for the entire dataset. This was used as a visual cue to see how well models did at fitting to its own data. 

## ModelScripts Folder

Outlines the numerous models utilized and tested. We used six different models for our project:
* ACP
* KNN
* Lasso
* Logistic Regression
* Poisson Regression
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest
* SARIMA (time series)

## Final Products
